# ðŸ©º Pulse

> **Lightweight health-check service for CI/CD pipelines, orchestration, and monitoring**

`pulse` is a minimal Express.js service that exposes a `/health` endpoint to verify that your application is running. Itâ€™s designed to be used in:

- Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes  
- GitHub Actions or any CI/CD pipeline  
- Infrastructure monitoring tools (Prometheus, Datadog, etc.)  
- Microservice architectures requiring a standard health check

Fast, dependency-free, and production-ready.
